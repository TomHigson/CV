I am responsible for the smooth integration of 3rd party products onto the MORPHEUS EvO network infrastructure. The strategic importance of this to the UK Ministry of Defence is described in [this press release](https://www.generaldynamics.uk.com/solutions/c4i-systems/evo/). Our activities include:
- Maintaining working relationships with multiple 3rd parties to encourage their use of our platform and gather their feedback
- I identified the need for and introduced DevOps specialists to improve release cadence, reduce defect severity and increase the projectâ€™s ability to react to change
	- Championed cultural change
	- Designed and implemented several automated pipelines across multiple teams
- Working to replace lab-based 3rd party integration with secure, web-based, self-service integration environments
