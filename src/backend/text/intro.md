I am a multi-disciplined engineer based in [South Wales](https://goo.gl/maps/8GXyjQeBX362) with 12 years of industry experience ranging from experimental prototypes to in-service support

As an architect, I am passionate about creating systems that are beautiful in their simplicity, their sharp focus on their needs and in the experience they provide to users

As a leader, I strive to:
- Provide clear, realistic tasks, protected from context switches and interruptions
- Form an environment of openness and respect
- Provide safe spaces to grow
- Value all contributions, suggestions and concerns
- Defend mistakes, and help teams accept and grow from them
