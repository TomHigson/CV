This CV is not just a CV, it's an open source web app that:
- Separates app shell and content connected with data services
- Is hosted as [an Azure web app](coming soon...), utilising Azure blob storage for content
- Leverages properly formatted Angular structuring to allow component reuse
- Is service worker ready â€“ try disconnecting from the internet and reloading the page!

As my work is typically security controlled and so cannot be shared, I hope this CV helps demonstrate some of my technical abilities. Check out [the repository](https://github.com/TomHigson/CV) for more details
