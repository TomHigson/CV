I was responsible for assessing the safety of advanced driver assistance systems. A demonstration of some of the systems I contributed to can be seen in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLdKrCWDaAg). 
My contributions included:
- Delivered safety cases for autonomy level 1 (hands on) systems
	- Led an activity to adapt a passenger vehicle safety case for trucks
	- Analysed the safety impact of different sensor configurations
	- Worked alongside project managers to plan system and safety milestones
	- Acted as the primary point of contact between prototype and project development teams
- Assisted in developing concepts for autonomy level 2 (hands off) systems
- Part-authored and reviewed key safety work products
	- Impact analysis
	- Failure mode and Effect Analysis for hardware design and production (DFMEA, PFMEA)
	- Failure Tree Analysis for software (FTA)
	- Robustness analysis
- Encouraged a stronger safety culture
	- Delivering safety training
	- Worked between multiple departments to determine, record and propagate best practice
- Managed 6 people and expanded the team by recruiting new talent
