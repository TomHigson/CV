I am in the very early stages of producing a web app that graphically represents recipes. [The source is available online](https://github.com/TomHigson/GraphicalRecipeSystem). Key features include:
- Multiple recipe views, including timelines, activities and step-by-step runthroughs
- Intuitive drag-and-drop to customise existing recipies
