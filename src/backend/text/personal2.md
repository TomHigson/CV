I am in the very early stages of producing a web app that graphically represents recipes. [The source will be available online soon](https://github.com/TomHigson/GraphicalRecipeSystem). Key features include:
- Multiple recipe views, including
  - Timelines
  - Activities
  - Step-by-step runthroughs
  - Nutritional information
- Intuitive drag-and-drop to customise existing recipies
