I am passionate about:

designing and creating beautiful systems. Beautiful in simplicity, beautiful in their sharp focus on the system needs and beautiful in the experience they provide to users.

As a team leader, I strive to:
Provide clear, realistic tasks, protected from context switches and interruptions
Form an environment of openness and respect
Provide safe spaces to grow
Value all contributions, suggestions and concerns
Defend mistakes, and help teams accept and grow from them

Proud to consistently have the highest staff retention rate of the departments I have worked in.

Personally progressing and self-funding Microsoft Certified Azure Administrator status with aim to be certified by Q3 2019.
